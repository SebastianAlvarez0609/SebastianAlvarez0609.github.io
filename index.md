Hi, I'm a Computer Science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2027 and attending graduate school afterwards. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 3, part 1
I found this lab enjoyable as it involved the prices and sizes of one of my favorite foods, pizza! In this part of the lab I had to implement the function PizzaUnitPrice and although it seemed hard to understand at the time as I had no experience with computer science, I eventually came to understand it and it emphasized the importance of understanding most mathematical concepts.

Lab 4, part 2
This lab really stood out to me because it made me think of the code from both sides of the game, the secret-keeper and the guesser in the high/low number game. Since my first year in high school before I actually knew the ins and outs of the field I thought it was just coding games and that's why I aspired to do it as a career. Even though it wasn't a high end game or anything it is still a lab that I'll never forget and the emphasis on if statements which carried on to almost all the labs afterwards.

Lab 10, part 2
This was my favorite lab because it was undoubtedly the hardest in my opinion and really made me think. Back in my senior year I took AP Computer Science and it was based on Java so we learned about arrays instead of vectors. It was the hardest concept for me and I didn't understand it last year but after having it better explained this semester in lecture I finally got it and it was so relieving.
